# Project Roadmap

## TypeScript Migration
- Convert core files to TypeScript:
  - [ ] Create type definitions for GameBoyCore and emulator interfaces
  - [ ] Convert context files (AuthContext, GameContext, SettingsContext)
  - [ ] Add proper typing for AWS Amplify interactions
  - [ ] Define interfaces for game state and save state management

## Architecture Improvements

### Feature-based Organization

### Component Refactoring
- [ ] Create reusable UI components:
  - Button (primary, secondary, danger variants)
  - Modal (base modal with composition pattern)
  - Form elements (input, select, checkbox)
- [ ] Implement proper loading states using Suspense
- [ ] Add error boundaries for each major feature

## Performance Optimization

### Emulator Core
- [ ] Optimize GameBoyCore performance
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup for memory management
- [ ] Add frame skipping for performance boost
- [ ] Optimize canvas rendering

### State Management
- [ ] Implement proper state persistence
- [ ] Add auto-save functionality with configurable intervals
- [ ] Optimize save state storage and retrieval
- [ ] Add save state compression

## User Experience

### Save State Management
- [x] Multiple save states per game
- [x] Custom titles and descriptions for save states
- [x] Progress metrics for save states
- [ ] Save state previews with screenshots
- [ ] Quick save/load functionality

### Game Enhancement Features
- [ ] Keyboard input for text entry
- [ ] Custom control mapping
- [ ] Speed control improvements

## Mobile Experience
- [ ] Optimize touch controls
- [ ] Improve responsive design
- [ ] Add PWA support
- [ ] Implement proper mobile save state handling

## Infrastructure
- [ ] Add proper error logging

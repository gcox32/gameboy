# JS GBC

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), because of course it was.

The core emulator mechanics were adapted from this project: [GameBoy-Online](https://github.com/taisel/GameBoy-Online/tree/47f9f638a8a9445aaa75050f634e437baa34aae0). This guy did most of the legwork and I learned a lot about Javascript and even computer science from deconstructing his work.

The TODO list can be found [here](https://github.com/gcox32/gameboy/blob/main/TODO.md).
